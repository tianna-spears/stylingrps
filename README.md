This is a project from the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path (Unit 4/5).

The purpose of building this application is to sharpen styling React applications using various techniques such as inline styling syntax, object variable syntax, and CSS modules.

Thank you for your support! Feel free to check in as I continue to build my developer skills.
